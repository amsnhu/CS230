Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming ROom client goal is to expand their existing platforms for the game "Draw It Or Lose It" , this would allow users to access their game from different platforms instead of being limited to only the Android version. The requirements included being able to have team names, multiple players per team, and only having one instance of the game at a time.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
When developing the documentation on items that I composed particularly well was highlighting the expectation of the games, the pros and cons of each platform and the constraints of the game itself.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
When developing the code a process I found helpful was how structured the document was itself. I struggle with under documentation so this ensures that I had all the main aspects and didn't leave out any details.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I could revise the document I would probably add a section for the outline of the code instead of going straight into developing, Having the professor look over this outline or pseudocode to see if it's viable or needs improvement. This would also give everyone on the team a document to pinpoint your individual train of thought throughout the process of developing the code.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
To input the user needs I researched what the experience would be like on each platform the application would be available to , to ensure a smooth experience. It is important to address user needs in order to grow trust between the client and user which in turn will allow feasible feedback and scalability to more users.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
When designing this software the main approach was to research the needs the clients previously stated , figure out the requirements and constraints of the project and lead from there. Some techniques include agile methodologies which includes continuous testing and revisions and extensive research.
